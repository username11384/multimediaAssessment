  <div class="d-flex h-100 text-align align-items-center">
    <div class="w-100"><br />
      <p class="lead mb-0">There are two main protagonists in <b>My Dress-Up Darling</b>, which are Gojo Wakana and
        Marin Kitagawa.
        Marin is an outgoing and popular girl in the class, but in contrast, Gojo is the quiet person of the class, who
        people take advantage of.
        These two characters are complete opposites, but them meeting each other, they develop an interesting
        relationship....
        <br />
        <br />
        The characters are unique in terms of how they are, unlike every other romance-comedy anime, their way of
        meeting each other is rather
        quite strange. There are some other supporting characters who I'll also go over.
      </p><br /><br />

<div class="parallax bgimg-2">

<div class="container h-100">
  <div class="d-flex h-100 text-align align-items-center">
    <div class="w-100"><br />
      <h1 class="text-center sixty">Gojo Wakana</h1><br />
      <p class="lead mb-0">At the start of the series, Wakana was a withdrawn person in high school, having no friends
        and a secret love and
        admiration for hina dolls. This stems from his past where a girl angrily told him that boys shouldn’t like dolls
        and called him a
        freak, something that clearly affected him very deeply to the point where he closed himself off from everyone
        and lived his high school
        life as a recluse. Wakana notes Marin Kitagawa and how she has her own interests in anime and the like, but
        unlike him, is free to be
        completely open with them and has many friends. His solitary attitude makes him rather submissive with others,
        claiming that he doesn’t
        mind his classmates leaving him to do after class clean up, although Marin correctly pointed out that they were
        taking advantage of him.</p><br />

  <div class="d-flex h-100 text-align align-items-center">
    <div class="w-100"><br />
      <h1 class="text-center sixty">Marin Kitagawa</h1><br />
      <p class="lead mb-0">Marin is extravagant, messy, and while quite mature, she's also clumsy. As a cosplayer and
        huge otaku, Marin is a big of fan of
        magical girl anime and video games. She strongly desires to cosplay as certain characters, seeing the notion of
        dressing up and becoming said
        characters as the ultimate form of love for them. <br /><br />
        She is notably very kind, friendly, cheerful, and outgoing. It is shown that Marin greatly dislikes
        overly-critical people that judge others for
        their interests, causing her to reject the advances of a boy at the start of the series, who poked fun at her
        liking anime.</p><br />

    <div class="w-100"><br />
      <h1 class="text-center sixty">Shinju Inui</h1><br />
      <p class="lead mb-0">Unlike her sister, who is rather blunt and headstrong, Shinju is a timid yet kind-hearted
        girl. She is shown to get nervous easily,
        especially when meeting new people, as seen during her first meeting with Gojo and Marin. This aside, Shinju
        strongly admires and loves her sister,
        working as her cosplay photographer while also creating an online account to share her sister's work. Shinju
        likes the Flower Princess Blaze alongside
        Sajuna and Marin. Her favorite character from the series is the older brother Soma, due to his caring nature, as
        he reminds Shinju of her sister.

    <div class="w-100"><br />
      <h1 class="text-center sixty">Sajuna Inui</h1><br />
      <p class="lead mb-0">Sajuna is rather headstrong and blunt, despite her child-like appearance. She has no problem
        with chiding others or speaking harshly
        when it comes to it, and can be quick to lose her temper as well. Perhaps as a given, she dislikes being seen or
        referred to as a child, as seen when
        she first met Wakana Gojo. She is shown to take cosplaying seriously and loves dressing up as characters she
        adores. This stems from her own dream of
        wanting to become a "magical girl".
